ORDER BY 3,4

SELECT *
FROM `course-3-week-3-327122.Covid_Project.CovidVaccinations`
ORDER BY 3,4

--Select data that we are going to be using:

SELECT location, date, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, population
FROM `course-3-week-3-327122.Covid_Project.CovidDeaths`
ORDER BY 1,2

--Looking at Total_Cases vs Total_Deaths, and calculating the likelihood of dying if you contract COVID in your country:

SELECT location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM `course-3-week-3-327122.Covid_Project.CovidDeaths`
ORDER BY 1,2

SELECT location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM `course-3-week-3-327122.Covid_Project.CovidDeaths`
WHERE location = 'United States'
ORDER BY 1,2

SELECT location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM `course-3-week-3-327122.Covid_Project.CovidDeaths`
WHERE location = 'United States'
ORDER BY total_cases DESC
--This query above shows that as of 11/13/2021, the total cases is 47,050,502, total deaths is 762,972, and DeathPercentage is 1.6216022519802233 % in the USA

--Looking at Total Cases vs Population:
--Shows what percentage of the population has gotten COVID:

SELECT location, date, population, total_cases,(total_cases/population)*100 AS CasesPercentage
FROM `course-3-week-3-327122.Covid_Project.CovidDeaths`
WHERE location = 'United States'
ORDER BY 1,2

SELECT location, date, population, total_cases,(total_cases/population)*100 AS CasesPercentage
FROM `course-3-week-3-327122.Covid_Project.CovidDeaths`
WHERE location = 'United States'
ORDER BY date DESC
--This query above shows that as of 11/13/2021, the population is 332,915,074, total cases is 47,050,502, and CasesPercentage is 14.132884232211126 % in the USA
--In other words, roughly 14% of the population of the USA has gotten COVID so far

--Looking at countries with the highest infection rate compared to population:
SELECT location, population, MAX(total_cases) AS HighestInfectionCount,(MAX(total_cases)/population)*100 AS PercentPopulationInfected
FROM `course-3-week-3-327122.Covid_Project.CovidDeaths`
GROUP BY location, population
ORDER BY PercentPopulationInfected DESC

--Showing countries with the highest death count compared to population:
SELECT location, population, MAX(cast(total_deaths as INT)) AS HighestDeathCount,(MAX(total_deaths)/population)*100 AS PercentPopulationDead
FROM `course-3-week-3-327122.Covid_Project.CovidDeaths`
WHERE continent is not null
GROUP BY location, population
ORDER BY PercentPopulationDead DESC
