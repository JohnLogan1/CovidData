--Looking at Total Cases vs Population:
--Shows what percentage of the population has gotten COVID:

--Joining covid_deaths and covid_vaccination tables together
--BigQuery wouldn't let me do join functions without upgrading my membership, so I wasn't able to run this:
SELECT *
FROM `course-3-week-3-327122.Covid_Project.CovidDeaths`
JOIN `course-3-week-3-327122.Covid_Project.CovidVaccinations`
    ON CovidDeaths.location = CovidVaccinations.location

SELECT location, date, new_vaccinations, SUM(cast(new_vaccinations as INT)) OVER (PARTITION BY location ORDER BY date) AS RollingPeopleVaccinated
FROM `course-3-week-3-327122.Covid_Project.CovidVaccinations`
WHERE continent is not null
ORDER BY 1,2
--Finding the amount of new vaccinations per day in each country, with a column to sum up the number of new vaccinations by location and ordered by the date


--Had to go back and create a new table in Excel to add the population column to the CovidVaccinations table, since BigQuery would not let me do JOIN commands without 
--getting a membership. This new table was titled "CovidVaccinations_Population"

--Finding the percent of the population that is vaccinated:
SELECT continent, location, date, population, new_vaccinations, SUM(CAST(new_vaccinations AS int)) 
    OVER (PARTITION BY location ORDER BY location, date) AS RollingPeopleVaccinated, (RollingPeopleVaccinated/Population)*100 as PercentofPopVaccinated
FROM `course-3-week-3-327122.Covid_Project.CovidVaccinations_Population`
WHERE continent is not null
--This query created a rolling count for people who are vaccinated by location and country
--This query was then created as a view, titled "PercentPopulationVaccinated"

SELECT continent, location, date, population, new_vaccinations, SUM(CAST(new_vaccinations AS int)) 
    OVER (PARTITION BY location ORDER BY location, date) AS RollingPeopleVaccinated, (RollingPeopleVaccinated/Population)*100 as PercentPopVaccinated
